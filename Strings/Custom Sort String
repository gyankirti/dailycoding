/*
You are provided with the two strings named X and Y respectively. Y has its own specific order and has no repeating characters. Your task is to arrange the characters of the first string i.e. X in such a way that the order of characters in X is exactly the same as in Y, which means if ‘d’ occurs after ‘c’ in Y then it should also occur after ‘c’ in X ( obviously if X has ‘d’ and ‘c’ as characters in it ). All you have to do is, convert string X in the specific order with respect to string Y.

Note :

Both the strings have only lowercase English alphabets. 
There may be more than one correct solution, you have to return any one of the possible solutions.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= |X| <= 10000
1 <= |Y| <= 26
where ‘T’ is the number of test cases, |X| is the length of the first string and |Y| is the length of the second string.
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1
acabd
abc
Sample Output 1:
aabcd
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
String Y has ‘a’ first then ‘b’ and then ‘c’ and therefore string X must be ordered as ‘aabcd’ to keep the respective order of characters same as in string Y.
Other possible answers are: ‘daabc’ , ‘adabc’ , ‘aadbc’, ‘aabdc’.
Sample Input 2:
4
dfhfgk
h
aabbb
gd
abababab
ab
cag
abcdef
Sample Output 2:
hdffgk
aabbb
aaaabbbb
acg
